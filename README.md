# tic_tac_toe

This is the repo of my sample project Tic Tac Toe. The repo contains both the frontend and the backend of the game.  

Both the app and the server have their own ReadMe files. From there you can find more details about the app and the server and how to get them up and running.

## Getting started

Clone this whole repo with:  
`git clone https://github.com/hjarve/tic_tac_toe.git`

After that, open the app and the server in their own CLIs.
See the details for starting the app and the server from their own ReadMe files.
